# WiFiLocalization

The goal of this project is to provide an alternative to GPS for indoor areas. By using a mobile's received signal strength
intensity (RSSI) from multiple wireless access points (WAPs) in the building, the classifier model can predict the location of
the mobile device within the building. This project was completed in both Python and R.
